This repository contains implementations of several machine learning models applied to well-known datasets, including the Iris dataset, Wine dataset, and others. The models include:

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Datasets: Iris, Wine

Description: KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the nearest neighbors to a given data point and using their labels to predict the class of the new point.

Features:
Handles multi-class classification problems.
Demonstrates how distance metrics are applied in classification.
Includes confusion matrix and classification report visualizations.


# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Description: A basic ANN implementation that includes feedforward propagation for forward pass and backpropagation for learning through error minimization.

Features:
Includes hidden layers, activation functions (Sigmoid, etc.).
Implements gradient descent for weight updates.
Can be applied to various classification or regression tasks.


# Decision Tree Classifier

Dataset: Generalized for classification tasks (including Tennis dataset, or other tabular datasets).

Description: A tree-based model used for classification problems, where the data is split into decision nodes based on feature values.

Features:
Includes visualization of decision trees.
Generates human-readable decision rules.
Demonstrates the ability to handle categorical and continuous data.
